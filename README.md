# OpenWrt-Wi-Fi-Attack-Tool
# Wireless Network Pentest Script for OpenWrt

This repository contains a robust bash script designed for wireless network penetration testing on OpenWrt-compatible devices. The script provides an all-in-one solution for scanning, selecting, and attacking wireless networks, utilizing monitor mode on supported interfaces.

---

## Features
- **Automatic Interface Selection**: Lists available interfaces and sets the chosen one to monitor mode.
- **Network Scanning**: Scans for nearby wireless networks, saving details (BSSID, channel, encryption type) to a CSV file.
- **Target Selection**: Choose a target from the scanned networks for further analysis.
- **Attack Modes**: Select attack type and execute it on the selected target.
- **Monitor Mode Reset**: Automatically returns interfaces to managed mode after completion, ensuring no disruption to the network.

---

## Requirements
- **OpenWrt-Compatible Device**: Ensure that your router supports OpenWrt and can enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces.
- **Necessary Packages**: The following packages are required on OpenWrt:
  - `airmon-ng`
  - `iw`
  - `aircrack-ng`

Install packages using:
```bash
opkg update && opkg install <package_name>
Installation
Clone this repository to your OpenWrt device:


git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Wireless-Network-Pentest-Script-for-OpenWrt.git
cd Wireless-Network-Pentest-Script-for-OpenWrt
Make the script executable:


chmod +x new.sh
Usage
Run the Script:


./new.sh
Select the Interface: Choose an interface from the listed options to set in monitor mode.

Scan Networks: The script initiates a network scan and saves results in a CSV file.

Choose Target: After scanning, pick a target BSSID from the CSV.

Select Attack Mode: Follow prompts to execute specific attacks on the target.

Example Output

Available network interfaces:
1) phy0-ap0
2) phy1-ap0
Select the interface name (e.g., phy0-ap0): phy1-ap0
Setting phy1-ap0 to monitor mode...
Monitor mode enabled on mon0.
Scanning for networks on mon0...
Network scanning completed. BSSIDs saved to networks-<timestamp>.csv.
Choose a target from networks-<timestamp>.csv for the attack.
Enter BSSID of target:
