## Features
- **Automatic Interface Selection**: Lists available interfaces and sets the chosen one to monitor mode.
- **Network Scanning**: Scans for nearby wireless networks, saving details (BSSID, channel, encryption type) to a CSV file.
- **Target Selection**: Choose a target from the scanned networks for further analysis.
- **Attack Modes**: Select attack type and execute it on the selected target.
- **Monitor Mode Reset**: Automatically returns interfaces to managed mode after completion, ensuring no disruption to the network.
